🏗️ Technical Architecture Plan – Family Expense Tracker App
1. System Overview

The Family Expense Tracker is a multi-role, cross-platform application with secure financial data handling, supporting:

Mobile Apps (iOS & Android) and Web Client

Role-Based Access Control (Parent, Partner, Teen, Child)

Bank Integrations for syncing transactions

Gamification & Education modules for kids/teens

Cloud Backend with secure APIs and real-time notifications

2. Core Components

Frontend Layer

Mobile Apps (React Native / Flutter)

Web App (React + Next.js)

Role-specific UIs

Backend Layer

API Gateway (GraphQL/REST)

Auth & Role Management (JWT + RBAC)

Expense Service (CRUD for expenses, budgets)

Goal & Allowance Service

Gamification Service

Notification Service (Push, Email)

Bank Integration Service (Plaid/Finicity APIs)

Database Layer

Relational DB (Postgres/MySQL) for structured data

NoSQL (MongoDB/Firestore) for gamification/events

Redis for caching & real-time sync

Security

End-to-end encryption (TLS)

Token-based authentication (JWT/OAuth2)

Parental consent & privacy (COPPA/GDPR compliance)

Infrastructure

Cloud deployment (AWS/GCP/Azure)

Containerized (Docker + Kubernetes)

CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions/GitLab CI)

Monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana, ELK Stack)

5. Key Architectural Considerations

Scalability: Microservices design allows independent scaling of expense, goals, and gamification services.

Security: End-to-end encryption + RBAC ensures family role segregation.

Extensibility: Gamification and financial literacy modules can be extended without disrupting core expense services.

Resilience: Circuit breakers for bank APIs to handle downtime gracefully.
