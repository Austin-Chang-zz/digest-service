### Note on UX Document
The UX document (30_ExpTracker_UX_0972.md) should also be updated to version 0.97.3 for consistency, but since it was not explicitly requested, I haven't modified it here. If needed, I can provide that update as well.

These changes address the recommendations by ensuring version alignment, adding dependency mapping, enhancing acceptance criteria, and including performance benchmarks and analytics requirements.
