This comprehensive UI/UX specification provides the foundation for implementing the Family Expense Tracker interface according to PRD v0.97.1 requirements, incorporating the new navigation structure (Home, Overview, Payment, Chat, My Center), Fund/Wallet management system, and chat functionality while preserving all detailed requirements from the previous version. The specification emphasizes multi-language support, responsive design, accessibility, and intuitive financial management for all family roles.

This merged document combines all the details from both versions, maintaining the new navigation structure and Fund/Wallet system from the current version while preserving all the detailed user flows, component specifications, and design guidelines from the previous version. The document is now saved as `30_ExpTracker_UX_0971.md`.
