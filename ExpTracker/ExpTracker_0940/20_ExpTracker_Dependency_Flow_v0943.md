# System Architecture & Dependency Flow — v0.94.3

> Derived from PRD v0.93.0 (Epics 0–9) and updated dependency chart
> 

---

## 1. Overview

This update (v0.94.3) aligns the **system dependency flow chart** with the latest PRD (v0.93.0), which includes **Epics 0–9**. It shows sequencing of Epics and Story-level dependencies, ensuring that foundational onboarding, authentication, and group management precede higher-value features.

## 2. Epic & Story Dependency Flow

    %% Core Foundation
    E0[Epic 0: Account Creation & Onboarding] --> E1[Epic 1: Authentication & Security]
    E1 --> E2[Epic 2: Group Management & Dashboard]

    %% Core MVP
    E2 --> E3[Epic 3: Core Expense Management]

    %% Value-Add
    E3 --> E4[Epic 4: Goals & Savings]
    E2 --> E5[Epic 5: Allowances & Chores]

    %% Engagement
    E4 --> E6[Epic 6: Gamification & Education]
    E5 --> E6

    %% Security & Notifications (system-wide)
    E0 --> E7[Epic 7: Advanced Notifications & Controls]
    E1 --> E7
    E2 --> E7
    E3 --> E7
    E4 --> E7
    E5 --> E7
    E6 --> E7

    %% System-wide Capabilities
    E0 --> E8[Epic 8: Multi-Language & RWD]
    E1 --> E8
    E2 --> E8
    E3 --> E8
    E4 --> E8
    E5 --> E8
    E6 --> E8
    E7 --> E8

    %% Monetization Layer
    E2 --> E9[Epic 9: Pricing & Subscription]
    E3 --> E9
    E8 --> E9

    %% Story-level dependencies (examples)
    S1[Story: Expense CRUD] --> S2[Story: Budget Alerts]
    S1 --> S3[Story: Bank Sync]
    S3 --> S2
    S4[Story: Role-Based Permissions] --> S5[Story: Parental Controls]
    S2 --> S5
    S6[Story: Pricing Free Trial] --> S7[Story: Subscription Payment]

```

## 3. Key Highlights

- **Foundational Layer:** Epics 0–2 must be implemented first (Onboarding, Auth, Dashboard).
- **Core Expense Management (Epic 3)** unlocks **Goals, Allowances, and Pricing integration**.
- **Gamification (Epic 6)** depends on both **Goals (Epic 4)** and **Allowances (Epic 5)**.
- **Notifications & Controls (Epic 7)** span across all Epics, enforcing security.
- **Multi-Language & RWD (Epic 8)** underpins every Epic, ensuring consistent global usability.
- **Pricing & Subscription (Epic 9)** relies on Dashboard, Expense features, and i18n foundation.
- **Story Dependencies:** CRUD precedes Alerts & Sync; Role-Based Permissions precede Parental Controls; Pricing Free Trial precedes Subscription Payment.

## 4. Next Steps

1. Use this dependency map to finalize sprint sequencing (MVP → Value-add → Engagement → Monetization).
2. Sync backlog with Jira to enforce dependencies.
3. Validate UX flows (v0.94.0) against dependency structure.

✅ Updated — **System Architecture v0.94.3** now reflects the **latest PRD v0.93.0 (Epics 0–9)** with a full Epic & Story dependency flow chart.

Would you like me to also **translate this dependency map into a sprint-by-sprint implementation plan** (Sprint 1 → Sprint N) for delivery sequencing?
