# Family Expense Tracker â€“ System Architecture Document (v0.96.0)

## Introduction

This document defines the full-stack system architecture for the Family Expense Tracker (aligned with PRD v0.96.0), updating the previous version (v0.94.0) to include major enhancements in calendar scheduling, multi-currency/exchange management, and refinements throughout the technical stack and workflow. It serves as the fundamental reference for AI-driven and manual implementation in all environments.

## Processing and Dependency Flows

- See updated attachment for sequence and block diagrams (v0.94.1, v0.94.2, v0.94.3)
- Calendars now subscribe to event/expense/goal/allowance schedules
- Currency layer transparently integrates with every expense/goal/allowance via hooks/service decorators
- Bank integration supports currency-detection, locale-sensitive category assignment
- All event-driven flows (notifications, recurring) centralize on calendar and currency triggers

---

## Infrastructure, DevOps & Security

**Infra:** AWS IaC (Terraform), blue-green deployment, rollback automation
**CI/CD:** GitHub Actions, full test matrix, staged promotion, security scanning (Snyk, Semgrep, ZAP)
**Env:** Dev/staging/prod, encrypted secrets (KMS, .env), global region coverage

**Security:**
- 2FA, RBAC, OAuth, JWT session rotation
- Rate limits, CORS, helmet, XSS/CSRF prevention
- PCI/GDPR/CCPA/PSD2 alignment for banking and payments
- FX rates/PII all encrypted at rest and in transit
- Language/currency/personal data pseudonymization where possible
- Monitoring: logging (Winston), distributed tracing, error reporting, alerting

---

## Error Handling & Test Strategy

- Layered (HTTP code, JSON error, custom exception hierarchies)
- Localized error dictionaries (all supported languages)
- Retry, circuit breaker, and fallback logic for all external APIs
- Transactional integrity; distributed Saga for cross-module, idempotency keys

**Testing:**
- TDD, >80% coverage, Playwright (E2E), Jest (unit/integration), Testcontainers (Postgres), OWASP ZAP+Lighthouse (sec, perf)
- All new calendar/currency features with scenario and edge case coverage

---

## Code & Implementation Standards

- TypeScript 5 everywhere, strict typing
- ESLint+Prettier; enforce style and import rules
- All new DB logic via Prisma, no raw SQL unless required
- All number/math involving currency via Decimal.js
- All UI/UX strings wrapped in i18n
- All errorable logic covered by automated tests
- All build/deploy via mono-repo scripts, Docker

---

## Source Tree, Modules, and API Spec

- See previous (v0.94.0) for monorepo structure; all new services/modules as above
- OpenAPI 3.0 spec extended in-place; all new endpoints for calendar, currency, etc. under /calendar, /currency

---

## Next Steps

1. Initiate updated Frontend Architecture (v0.96.0) with new modules and state mgmt for calendar/currency flows
2. Sync Jira/backlog structure to new Epic/Story/MVP sequence
3. Begin implementation stories for Epic 11, 12 after MVP core
4. Validate all test and infra setup for new modules
5. Continuous review and feedback per epic/sprint
