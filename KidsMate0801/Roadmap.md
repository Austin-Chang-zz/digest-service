## 2. Roadmap Structure & Version Planning
Development is organized into thematic phases:
1. **MVP (Q1 2026):** Validate core user loop and assumptions.
2. **V2.0 (Q3 2026):** Enrich features and commercialize the platform.
3. **V3.0 (Future):** Expand ecosystem and deepen market integration.

## 3. Detailed Version Plan

### Phase 1: MVP (Q1 2026)

### Phase 2: V2.0 (Q3 2026)

## 4. Feature Priority Matrix
| Priority | Description |
|---|---|
| **P0 (Critical)** | Must-have for the release. The release is not viable without these features. |
| **P1 (High)** | Important for creating a compelling and competitive product. |
| **P2 (Medium)** | Desirable feature that adds value but can be postponed if necessary. |

## 5. Timeline & Milestones
- **Q4 2025:** Finalize MVP design and technical architecture
- **Q1 2026:** MVP Development & Launch
- **Q2 2026:** Gather user feedback, begin V2.0 development
- **Q3 2026:** V2.0 Launch
- **Q4 2026:** Plan V3.0 and beyond

## 6. Risk Management
- **Technical Risk:** Adaptive AI engine is complex. *Mitigation:* Start with a simple rule-based system for MVP, iterate.
- **Market Risk:** Attracting suppliers and parents is a "chicken-and-egg" problem. *Mitigation:* Seed EdMall with launch partners, offer free access to parents initially.
- **Regulatory Risk:** Handling children's data requires strict compliance. *Mitigation:* Engage legal counsel early for COPPA/GDPR-K adherence.
