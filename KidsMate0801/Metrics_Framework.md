### **1. Metrics Framework Overview**

This document defines the key metrics that will be used to measure the success of KidsMate. It establishes a clear framework for data-driven decision-making.

### **2. North Star Metric**

  * **North Star Metric**: **Weekly Engaged Learning Minutes**
  * **Definition**: The total number of minutes per week that a child spends actively interacting with learning content (completing exercises, watching video lessons, engaging with the AI) and demonstrating progress.
  * **Rationale**: This single metric aligns the entire company with the core product value. It measures not just usage (minutes) but quality of usage (engaged learning), ensuring we focus on educational outcomes, not just screen time.

### **3. AARRR Metrics Framework**

The AARRR "Pirate Metrics" framework will be used to measure the health of the user funnel.

  * **Acquisition (How do users find us?)**
      * **KPIs**: Website traffic, user sign-up rate, cost per acquisition (CPA).
      * **Goal**: To understand which marketing channels are most effective at bringing in target users (parents).

      * **KPIs**: % of new users who complete child profile setup, % of children who complete their first lesson within 24 hours, % of parents who view the dashboard within their first week.
      * **Goal**: To ensure users experience the "aha\!" moment and understand the core value quickly.
