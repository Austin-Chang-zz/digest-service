# KidsMate 0.80.1 Backend Architecture

## 1. Overview
This document describes the backend architecture for KidsMate 0.80.1, supporting an AI-powered educational platform with real-time chat, content marketplace, parental dashboard, and adaptive learning.

## 2. Technology Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python (Django) or Node.js (Express)
- **AI/ML:** Python (TensorFlow, PyTorch, LLM fine-tuning)
- **Database:**
  - PostgreSQL (structured data: users, purchases, content)
  - MongoDB (unstructured data: chat logs, event tracking)
- **Payment Integration:** Stripe/PayPal
- **Authentication:** OAuth 2.0, JWT
- **APIs:** RESTful (OpenAPI/Swagger), GraphQL (optional for flexibility)

## 3. Core Modules & Responsibilities
### 3.1 User & Account Management
- Parent/child registration, authentication, profile management
- Role-based access control

### 3.2 AI Companion Service
- Real-time chat API (WebSocket/HTTP)
- Multi-language support (EN/CH/JP)
- Query routing to LLM engine
- Chat log storage (MongoDB)
- Parental review access

### 3.3 EdMall Marketplace
- Supplier onboarding & management
- Content listing, categorization, search/filter
- Shopping cart, order management
- Payment processing (Stripe/PayPal)
- Transaction history

### 3.4 Evaluation Dashboard
- Data aggregation: time spent, modules completed, scores
- Summative/formative evaluation logic
- Analytics API for frontend dashboard
- Data visualization endpoints

### 3.5 Adaptive Learning Engine
- Student progress tracking
- Dynamic content recommendation
- Differentiation logic for special needs
- Integration with AI/ML models

### 3.6 Community & Support
- User forums, Q&A, support ticketing (optional, future phase)

## 4. Data Model Overview
- **Users:** Parent, Child, Supplier (roles, profiles)
- **Content:** Lessons, modules, supplier metadata
- **Transactions:** Orders, payments, purchase history
- **Chat Logs:** Message history, timestamps, user references
- **Progress:** Activity logs, scores, evaluation records

## 5. Security & Compliance
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- COPPA/GDPR-K compliance for children’s data
- Audit logging and monitoring
- Secure API endpoints (rate limiting, input validation)

## 6. Scalability & Performance
- Stateless API servers (horizontal scaling)
- Caching (Redis/Memcached) for frequent queries
- Asynchronous task processing (Celery/RQ for Python, Bull for Node.js)
- Load balancing and health checks

## 7. Integration Points
- Third-party payment gateways
- Analytics platforms (Amplitude, Mixpanel)
- School LMS (future phase)

## 8. Deployment & DevOps
- Containerization (Docker)
- CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Jenkins)
- Cloud hosting (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Automated testing and monitoring

## 9. Future Considerations
- Gamification engine
- Student community features
- Mobile app backend APIs
